# Post-App-Mini-Project

# Project Overview

This mini-project is a simple web-based notes-taking application built using Node.js and Express.js, with file handling powered by the fs (File System) module. Instead of using a database for storing notes, this project directly saves the notes to the local file system, providing a lightweight and efficient way to manage personal notes.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how note-taking functionality can be implemented without the overhead of a database. By using the fs module in Node.js, this project provides a straightforward solution for storing and retrieving data in text files. This approach offers a clear example of file-based data management, useful for smaller applications where database integration might be unnecessary.
